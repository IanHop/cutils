# Types
This [header file](../inc/cutils/types.h) is at the root of all the header files in this library. It basically just uses stdint and stdbool and provides a few convenience macros. 

A handy assert macro is provided in [CUTILS_ASSERT](..//inc/cutils/types.h#L45)

Macros are also provided to help [stringify your enums](stringify.md).
